Firstly,
I called my mortgage adviser and they are not sure if the mortgage lenders are going to agree with the different dates for points 22 and 23:

21. The Applicant will transfer all her legal and beneficial interest in Shrubbery to the Respondent promptly after both of (a) completion of sale of Foxgloves and (b) 5 April 2023 and shall use her full CGT personal allowance in that year on this transaction.
AND
23. The Respondent shall use his best endeavours to procure the release of the
Applicant from any liability under the Shrubbery mortgage forthwith. He shall
ensure that the Applicant is released from any liability under the Shrubbery
mortgage by 4pm on the 31st of January 2023. The Respondent shall in any
event indemnify the Applicant against all such liability pursuant to the
Shrubbery mortgage.

The point 21 and 23 two have to happen at the same time. So the change the date for both to 31st of January 2023

Secondly,
The decree absolute must be filed by the applicant immediately as per the agreement today.

Can you confirm these points first?
